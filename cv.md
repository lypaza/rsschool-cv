## **About me**

I graduated from the VSTU, but did not go to work in my specialty.
Me always wanted to try myself in computer science, so while i'm young and i have time i started doing programming.
Now i'am studying at the RSschool course on JS. Before that, i was engaged in self-training on learn.javascript. 
I hope that everything will work out, even if not the first time, i will try again and again.
